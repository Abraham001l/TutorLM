# Friction Ramp Problem (I'm challenging a score received on a test)

Hello! First time, long time!  
  
This is kind of a long post. I did what I could to keep it clear. TYIA!  
  
I was marked totally wrong on a test question and I think I may have been
correct. I'm trying to get my ducks in a row before I ask the professor to
review this with/for me. Everyone in the class seems to have gotten different
answers so I don't have anything to compare it to.  
  
I believe that in this system, there is no acceleration because the friction
is too great. This calculator I found online agrees with my answers:  
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbasees/incpl2.html#c1  
  
Any thoughts or advice would be helpful.  
  
Please, help me stick it to the man! Or, keep me from making a jerk out of
myself.

## Homework Statement

  
The hanging 300g mass is connected to a 500g mass on a 35 degree downwards
incline by an ideal string/pulley arrangement. Calculate the acceleration of
the masses and the tension in the string when the system is released. The
friction coefficient between the 500g mass and the ramp is Mk=.150.  
  
Here is a picture of the situation:  

  
m1=500g  
m2=300g

## Homework Equations

  
F=ma  
w=mg  
N=mg(cos@) <----- @=theta  
Force parallel to ramp = mg(sin@)  
Friction=(N)(Mk)

## The Attempt at a Solution

  
For the 500g block:  
W = (.5)(9.8) = 4.9N  
N = (.5)(9.8)(cos35) = 4.01N  
Force parallel to ramp = (.5)(9.8)(sin35) = 2.81N  
Friction on ramp = (4.01)(.150) = .601N  
  
For the 300g (hanging) block:  
W = (.3)(9.8) = 2.94N  
  
OK, if we were totally frictionless we would get: Fnet = 2.94 - 2.81 = .13N
towards the hanging 300g block. This means:  
.13N = (.8kg)a  
a = .1625 m/s^2  
  
But, we have friction and friction works against _any_ motion. I believe that
in this system, the friction is too great to overcome with these masses. We
are in the zone where the blocks will not move.  
  
Since the system wants to move towards the 300g mass, friction opposes it:  
Fnet = 2.94N – 2.81N - .601N = -.471N  
  
Therefore, it will not accelerate towards the 300g hanging mass because the
friction is too great.  
  
AND, I just don’t get to add the friction as a force going down the hill and
say:  
Fnet = 2.81N + .601N – 2.94N = .471N  
  
This due to the fact that the friction would then _oppose_ the downhill motion
and bring me back to the first situation.  
_  
Therefore, we have too much friction in this system.  
  
Am I correct in my logic and reasoning?_  
  
Since there is no movement, the Tensions are equal to the weights of the
masses.  
T1 = 2.81N  
T2 = 2.94N

Solve. I don't think there would be too much friction. But I don't have a
calculator at hand to check it.

Hello! Thanks for responding.  
  
I get that. But, I don't think this is a problem where you can just plug the
numbers into the formula. I think it's one of those special cases where you
have intermediate values that prevent acceleration.  
  
With no friction:  
a = [(m2)g-(m1)(g)(sin@)] / [m1+m2]  
  
with numbers  
a = [(.3)(9.8) - (.5)(9.8)(sin35)] / [.5 +.3]  
a = .1618  
  
When we add friction:  
a = [(m2)g-(m1)(g)(sin@) - (Mu)(m1)(g)(cos@)] / [m1+m2]  
  
With numbers  
a = [(.3)(9.8) - (.5)(9.8)(sin35) - (.15)(.5)(9.8)(cos 35)] / [.5 +.3]  
a = -.591  
  
The _magnitude_ of the acceleration increases when you add friction. Plus the
acceleration changes directions. _I don 't see how that is possible._ That's
why I think this is in the intermediate range where the weights don't overcome
friction.  
  
Do you see the point I'm trying to make? Is this correct?  
  
Or, am I just crazy?

No, you are quite sane. I tended to agree with rockfreak until I cranked out
the numbers. In problems such as these, depending on the values, the mass on
the ramp could move up the plane, down the plane, or stand still. You have to
work it out, as you did. In this case, there is just enough static friction
force available to keep the system still (in equilibrium), where the
**static** friction force on the mass on the ramp is **less than**(mu_s)N.
Your tension calculation is wrong, however; the tension on both sides of the
pulley must be the same, whether the masses are moving or still. Don't forget
that there is still some static friction acting on the mass on the ramp.

Thanks for your help!  
  
UPDATE:  
I talked to the professor. She said that the _only_ time there is zero
movement is when the frictional force is _equal to_ (not greater than) the
forces creating movement. If there is any difference, there is movement
acceleration.  
  
So, no extra points for me.  
  
Honestly, I don't buy this explanation because it entirely negates the idea
that friction could hold something in place. I was under the impression that
friction always against _any_ motion. Not just against the direction of the
initial tug.  
  
For example, by her logic, if I have my initial situation but with Mk=.95 (say
it's covered in velcro), the block would fly down the the ramp at 32.23 m/s^2
(I did the math). Obviously, this does not happen.  
  
Hmmm... maybe I'll try her one more time with this example.

You're entirely correct. There's no need to solve rock.freak667's equations if
the friction force is too great for movement, nor is it valid because the
maximum of the friction force is [itex] -\mu m g cos \theta [/itex], the force
can be smaller.

Exactly!  
  
My professor is essentially saying that the force of friction between the
block and ramp is _exceeding_ the other force on the block. Therefore, the
force of friction is causing the block to move. This is impossible; the
frictional force cannot do this.  
  
At least I _feel_ vindicated even if my grade didn't change.  
  
I think I'll let this rest now... that is unless at the end of the semester,
I'm 1% from the next letter grade.  
  
Thanks for your input.
