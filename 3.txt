#  Intuitive way to write out Matrix Multiplication

I was never taught to write out matrix multiplication this way, maybe others
have, but I came up with it independently recently when I was getting back
into linear algebra. The key is that the top of the first matrix and the left
side of the second matrix need to form a *square*. Writing out matrix
multiplications like this makes them way more intuitive, including immediately
knowing the dimensions of your output matrix, which is really useful in
practice. It is also easy to extend for multiplying many matrices in sequence
as well as left multiplying. Hopefully this helps you out as much as it did me
