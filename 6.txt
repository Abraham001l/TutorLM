I love fuego. I do think their queso has flour in it because my joints were
very sore the next day despite ordering gluten free tacos and queso. I did not
realize their were gluten free symbols on the menu at the time

We had the Fuego bowls and they were both filling and delicious. An order at
the counter, delivery to the table sort of place. The cookies looked out of
this world delicious, but they were made with wheat.

It was absolutely amazing.....all flavors were over the top great. I agree
with the other comments about the corn tortilla being very substantial, with
superior texture and flavor, but I don't understand how it doesn't have flour
in it. My dining partner suggested that lard is the secret ingredient. I live
in Austin in a neighborhood that is very friendly to people who eat Gluten
free, but this place was so great it is worth the 40 minutes it took to get
home times 2, any day of the week.

This location was a total mess. No organization, super loud music so the
cashier couldn't hear me when I asked about gluten, and my fiance didn't get
one of his tacos. Best to avoid this place. I am not confident at all about
their procedures handling gluten. The worker I saw handling the trash was also
handing out people's food….

Menu marked GF. Their corn tortillas are made in house, the best most durable
corn tortillas I have had! I did however believe it to be a flour tortilla at
first because the look and taste but I was reassured, and then compared it to
someone with me and it was for sure corn! They're just that good! Been
multiple times and never had a issue with cross contamination

Although there are clear menu items that are GF, there has been two separate
times when I was served tacos on a flour tortilla. So just be aware, and
double check.

Staff is usually pretty good about the gluten free stuff, and I'm a celiac and
have never had a problem eating there. Their corn tortillas are made there and
are big and durable!! No doubling up. There is definitely a chance for cross
contamination but like I've said, I have never had an issue

So good! A great taco option when we come to Waco. I made it clear at the
beginning that I was gluten free and they were very understanding. I played it
safe and got a taco in a bowl since I believe the corn and flour tortillas are
warmed in the same grill, so I definitely recommend just getting a taco in a
bowl. I only am not giving 5 stars because I would do a different taco in the
future. I got the Top of the Day but it was too much queso.

No items are listed as gluten free, only a few items on the menu are listed as
flour free and they note that cross contamination can occur.  
  
My child had a little bit of chicken from one of the bowls listed as flour
free and was not interested in the other items in the bowl.  
  
The food was okay but definitely does not feel like a safe option for Celiacs.

The food is not good and Service is bad. I went on 12/3/2023 with my friend
and firstly my taco was cold. I ended up fixing my taco with my friends
tortilla and asked them to swap my friends tortilla for another. They threw it
and said no we can't take care of that. Last time I will go or recommend that
restaurant. Very Bad Service.
