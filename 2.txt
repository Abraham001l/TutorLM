# Matrix Multiplication Calculator

Here you can perform **matrix multiplication** with complex numbers online for
free. However matrices can be not only two-dimensional, but also one-
dimensional (vectors), so that you can multiply vectors, vector by matrix and
vice versa.  
After calculation you can multiply the result by another matrix right
there!Have questions? Read the instructions.Matrix A dimension:XMatrix B

### About the method

  1. The main condition of matrix multiplication is that the number of columns of the 1st matrix must equal to the number of rows of the 2nd one.
  2. As a result of multiplication you will get a new matrix that has the same quantity of rows as the 1st one has and the same quantity of columns as the 2nd one.
  3. For example if you multiply a matrix of 'n' x 'k' by 'k' x 'm' size you'll get a new one of 'n' x 'm' dimension.

To understand matrix multiplication better input any example and examine the
solution.▲ Up© reshish.com 2011 - 2025Mobile versionPrivacy Policy|
