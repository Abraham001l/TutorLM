## Static Friction and Kinetic Friction

Recall from the previous chapter that friction is a force that opposes
relative motion parallel to the contact surface of the interacting objects and
is around us all the time. Friction allows us to move, which you have
discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice.

There are different types of friction—kinetic and static. Kinetic friction
acts on an object in relative motion, while static friction acts on an object
or system at rest relative to each other. The maximum static friction is
usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects.

##  Teacher Support

###  Teacher Support

[BL][OL] Review the concept of friction.

[AL] Start a discussion about the two kinds of friction: static and kinetic.
Ask students which one they think would be greater for two given surfaces.
Explain the concept of coefficient of friction and what the number would imply
in practical terms. Look at the table of static and kinetic friction and ask
students to guess which other systems would have higher or lower coefficients.

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor.
You may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means
that the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to
and in the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard
enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion,
it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started because the
kinetic friction force is less than the static friction force. If you were to
add mass to the crate, (for example, by placing a box on top of it) you would
need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. If, on
the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the
crate started and keep it going.

Figure 5.33 shows how friction occurs at the interface between two objects.
Magnifying these surfaces shows that they are rough on the microscopic level.
So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must
raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface
hitting, break off the points, or do both. The harder the surfaces are pushed
together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is
needed to move them.

Figure  5.33 Frictional forces, such as **f** , always oppose motion or
attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because
of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view.

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static friction,
the other for kinetic friction. When there is no motion between the objects,
the magnitude of static friction **f s** is

f s ≤ μ s N s , f s ≤ μ s N s ,

where  μ s μ s is the coefficient of static friction and **N** is the
magnitude of the normal force. Recall that the normal force acts perpendicular
to the surface and prevents the crate from falling through the floor. It
opposes the force of gravity in this example, but that will not always be the
case.

Since the symbol  ≤ ≤ means less than or equal to, this equation says that
static friction can have a maximum value of  μ s N. μ s N. That is,

f s (max)= μ s N. f s (max)= μ s N.

Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite
to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force
exceeds **f** s(max), the object will move. Once an object is moving, the
magnitude of kinetic friction **f** k is given by

f k = μ k N. f k = μ k N.

where  μ k μ k is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

Friction varies from surface to surface because different substances are
rougher than others. Table 5.2 compares values of static and kinetic friction
for different surfaces. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two
surfaces that are in contact.

System | Static Friction  μ s μ s | Kinetic Friction  μ k μ k  
---|---|---  
Rubber on dry concrete | 1.0 | 0.7  
Rubber on wet concrete | 0.7 | 0.5  
Wood on wood | 0.5 | 0.3  
Waxed wood on wet snow | 0.14 | 0.1  
Metal on wood | 0.5 | 0.3  
Steel on steel (dry) | 0.6 | 0.3  
Steel on steel (oiled) | 0.05 | 0.03  
Teflon on steel | 0.04 | 0.04  
Bone lubricated by synovial fluid | 0.016 | 0.015  
Shoes on wood | 0.9 | 0.7  
Shoes on ice | 0.1 | 0.05  
Ice on ice | 0.1 | 0.03  
Steel on ice | 0.4 | 0.02  
  
Table  5.2 Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction

Since friction always opposes relative motion, the direction of friction is
upward along the plane if the object is at rest or sliding down the incline.
For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor)
has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight

W=mg=(100kg)(9.80 m/s 2 )=980 N, W=mg=(100kg)(9.80 m/s 2 )=980 N,

perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you
would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than

f s (max)= μ s N=(0.45)(980 N)=440 N f s (max)= μ s N=(0.45)(980 N)=440 N

to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient
of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290 N

f k = μ k N=(0.30)(980 N)=290 N f k = μ k N=(0.30)(980 N)=290 N

would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor were lubricated, both
coefficients would be much smaller than they would be without lubrication. The
coefficient of friction is unitless and is a number usually between 0 and 1.0,
but there is no theoretical upper limit to its value.

## Working with Inclined Planes

We discussed previously that when an object rests on a horizontal surface,
there is a normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Up
until now, we dealt only with normal force in one dimension, with gravity and
normal force acting perpendicular to the surface in opposing directions
(gravity downward, and normal force upward). Now that you have the skills to
work with forces in two dimensions, we can explore what happens to weight and
the normal force on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane. For inclined
plane problems, it is easier breaking down the forces into their components if
we rotate the coordinate system, as illustrated in Figure 5.34. The first step
when setting up the problem is to break down the force of weight into
components.

Figure  5.34 The diagram shows perpendicular and horizontal components of
weight on an inclined plane.

##  Teacher Support

###  Teacher Support

[BL] Review the concepts of mass, weight, gravitation and normal force.

[OL] Review vectors and components of vectors.

When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle  θ θ with the
horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two
components: A force acting perpendicular to the plane,  w ⊥ w ⊥ , and a force
acting parallel to the plane,  w || w || . The perpendicular force of weight,
w ⊥ w ⊥ , is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the
normal force,  N. N. The force acting parallel to the plane,  w || w || ,
causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction,  f f
, opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.

It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into
components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle  θ θ to the horizontal,
then the magnitudes of the weight components are

w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ) and w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ) and

w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ). w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ).

Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine
them from reason. To do this, draw the right triangle formed by the three
weight vectors. Notice that the angle of the incline is the same as the angle
formed between  w w and  w ⊥ w ⊥ . Knowing this property, you can use
trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the weight components

cos(θ)= w ⊥ w w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ) cos(θ)= w ⊥ w w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ)

sin(θ)= w || w w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ). sin(θ)= w || w w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ).

[BL][OL][AL] Experiment with sliding different objects on inclined planes to
understand static and kinetic friction. Which objects need a larger angle to
slide down? What does this say about the coefficients of friction of those
systems? Is a greater force required to start the motion of an object than to
keep it in motion? What does this say about static and kinetic friction? When
does an object slide down at constant velocity? What does this say about
friction and normal force?

This video shows how the weight of an object on an inclined plane is broken
down into components perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane.
It explains the geometry for finding the angle in more detail.

When the surface is flat, you could say that one of the components of the
gravitational force is zero; Which one? As the angle of the incline gets
larger, what happens to the magnitudes of the perpendicular and parallel
components of gravitational force?

  1. When the angle is zero, the parallel component is zero and the perpendicular component is at a maximum. As the angle increases, the parallel component decreases and the perpendicular component increases. This is because the cosine of the angle shrinks while the sine of the angle increases.

  2. When the angle is zero, the parallel component is zero and the perpendicular component is at a maximum. As the angle increases, the parallel component decreases and the perpendicular component increases. This is because the cosine of the angle increases while the sine of the angle shrinks.

  3. When the angle is zero, the parallel component is zero and the perpendicular component is at a maximum. As the angle increases, the parallel component increases and the perpendicular component decreases. This is because the cosine of the angle shrinks while the sine of the angle increases.

  4. When the angle is zero, the parallel component is zero and the perpendicular component is at a maximum. As the angle increases, the parallel component increases and the perpendicular component decreases. This is because the cosine of the angle increases while the sine of the angle shrinks.

##  Tips For Success

Normal force is represented by the variable  N. N. This should not be confused
with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter N. It
is important to tell apart these symbols, especially since the units for
normal force (  N N ) happen to be newtons (N). For example, the normal force,
N N , that the floor exerts on a chair might be  N=100 N. N=100 N. One
important difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is
simply a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations!

To review, the process for solving inclined plane problems is as follows:

  1. Draw a sketch of the problem.
  2. Identify known and unknown quantities, and identify the system of interest.
  3. Draw a free-body diagram (which is a sketch showing all of the forces acting on an object) with the coordinate system rotated at the same angle as the inclined plane. Resolve the vectors into horizontal and vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram.
  4. Write Newton’s second law in the horizontal and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the object does not accelerate in a particular direction (for example, the _x_ -direction) then **F** net _x_ = 0. If the object does accelerate in that direction, **F** net _x_ = _m_**a**.
  5. Check your answer. Is the answer reasonable? Are the units correct?

##  Worked Example

###  Finding the Coefficient of Kinetic Friction on an Inclined Plane

A skier, illustrated in Figure 5.35(a), with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a
snowy slope at an angle of 25 degrees. Find the coefficient of kinetic
friction for the skier if friction is known to be 45.0 N.

Figure  5.35 Use the diagram to help find the coefficient of kinetic friction
for the skier.

##  Strategy

The magnitude of kinetic friction was given as 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is
related to the normal force **N** as  f k = μ k N f k = μ k N . Therefore, we
can find the coefficient of kinetic friction by first finding the normal force
of the skier on a slope. The normal force is always perpendicular to the
surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal
force should equal the component of the skier’s weight perpendicular to the
slope.

That is,

N= w ⊥ =w cos( 25 ∘ )=mg cos( 25 ∘ ) . N= w ⊥ =w cos( 25 ∘ )=mg cos( 25 ∘ ) .

Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we get

f k = μ k mg  cos 25 ∘ , f k = μ k mg  cos 25 ∘ ,

which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction _μ_ k.

Solution

Solving for  μ k μ k gives

μ k = f k w  cos 25 ∘ = f k mg  cos 25 ∘ . μ k = f k w  cos 25 ∘ = f k mg  cos
25 ∘ .

Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,

μ k = 45.0 N (62 kg)(9 .80 m/s 2 )(0.906) =0.082 . μ k = 45.0 N (62 kg)(9 .80
m/s 2 )(0.906) =0.082 .

Discussion

This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in Table 5.2 for
waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable since values of the
coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this, where an
object of mass _m_ slides down a slope that makes an angle _θ_ with the
horizontal, friction is given by  f k = μ k mg cosθ. f k = μ k mg cosθ.

##  Worked Example

###  Weight on an Incline, a Two-Dimensional Problem

The skier’s mass, including equipment, is 60.0 kg. (See Figure 5.36(b).) (a)
What is her acceleration if friction is negligible? (b) What is her
acceleration if the frictional force is 45.0 N?

Figure  5.36 Now use the diagram to help find the skier's acceleration if
friction is negligible and if the frictional force is 45.0 N.

##  Strategy

The most convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has
one coordinate parallel to the slope and one perpendicular to the slope.
Remember that motions along perpendicular axes are independent. We use the
symbol  ⊥ ⊥ to mean perpendicular, and  || || to mean parallel.

The only external forces acting on the system are the skier’s weight,
friction, and the normal force exerted by the ski slope, labeled  w w ,  f f ,
and  N N in the free-body diagram.  N N is always perpendicular to the slope
and  f f is parallel to it. But  w w is not in the direction of either axis,
so we must break it down into components along the chosen axes. We define  w
|| w || to be the component of weight parallel to the slope and  w ⊥ w ⊥ the
component of weight perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can
consider the two separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces
perpendicular to the slope.

Solution

The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is  w ||
=wsin(25°)=mgsin(25°) w || =wsin(25°)=mgsin(25°) , and the magnitude of the
component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is  w ⊥
=wcos(25°)=mgcos(25°). w ⊥ =wcos(25°)=mgcos(25°).

(a) Neglecting friction: Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we
only need to consider forces parallel to the slope. Forces perpendicular to
the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction. The
forces parallel to the slope are the amount of the skier’s weight parallel to
the slope  w || w || and friction  f f . Assuming no friction, by Newton’s
second law the acceleration parallel to the slope is

a || = F net || m , a || = F net || m ,

Where the net force parallel to the slope  F net || = w || =mgsin(25°) F net
|| = w || =mgsin(25°) , so that

a || = F net || m = mgsin(25°) m =gsin(25°) = (9.80  m/s 2 )(0.423)=4.14  m/s
2 a || = F net || m = mgsin(25°) m =gsin(25°) = (9.80  m/s 2 )(0.423)=4.14
m/s 2

is the acceleration.

(b) Including friction: Here we now have a given value for friction, and we
know its direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes motion between
surfaces in contact. So the net external force is now

F net || = w || −f, F net || = w || −f,

and substituting this into Newton’s second law,  a || = F net || m a || = F
net || m gives

a || = F net || m = w || −f m = mgsin(25°)−f m . a || = F net || m = w || −f m
= mgsin(25°)−f m .

We substitute known values to get

a || = (60.0 kg)(9 .80 m/s 2 )(0.423)−45.0 N 60.0 kg , a || = (60.0 kg)(9 .80
m/s 2 )(0.423)−45.0 N 60.0 kg ,

or

a || =3 .39 m/s 2 , a || =3 .39 m/s 2 ,

which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45 N opposing
friction.

Discussion

Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is
smaller when there is friction than when there is not.

###  Friction at an Angle: Sliding a Coin

An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net
force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient
of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in the first Worked Example,
the kinetic friction on a slope  f k = μ k mg cosθ f k = μ k mg cosθ , and the
component of the weight down the slope is equal to  mg sinθ mg sinθ . These
forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the
acceleration is zero. Writing these out

f k = F g x μ k mg cosθ = mg sinθ. f k = F g x μ k mg cosθ = mg sinθ.

Solving for  μ k μ k , since  tanθ=sinθ/cosθ tanθ=sinθ/cosθ we find that

μ k = mg sinθ mg cosθ = tanθ. μ k = mg sinθ mg cosθ = tanθ.
