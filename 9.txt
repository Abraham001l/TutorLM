## **Problem**[]

Figure 1

The free-body diagram (Figure 1) illustrates a block of mass  m {\displaystyle
m} that is stationary on a ramp (inclined plane). The angle of inclination is
α {\displaystyle \alpha} , and the coefficient of static friction is  μ s
{\displaystyle {\mu}_{s} } .

  
**Part 1:** Identify the forces  F 1 , F 2 , F 3 {\displaystyle F_1, F_2, F_3}
on the free-body diagram.

**Part 2:** Determine the formula for calculating the largest angle in which
the block will remain stationary.

**Part 3:** If the coefficient of static friction is 0.8, what is the maximum
angle  α {\displaystyle \alpha} ?

  

## **Solution**[]

**Part 1**

F 1 {\displaystyle F_1} is the gravitational force  F g {\displaystyle F_g} .

F 2 {\displaystyle F_2} is the normal force  F N {\displaystyle F_N} .

F 3 {\displaystyle F_3 } is the static friction force  F f s {\displaystyle
{F}_{fs} } .

**Part 2**

Organize the forces in this problem in two directions: perpendicular to the
ramp and parallel to the ramp. Then write the equations of motion  F n e t = m
a {\displaystyle {F}_{net} = ma } . Note that the gravitational force needs to
be resolved into each component. The perpendicular component is  F g ⊥ = m g
cos ⁡ ( α ) {\displaystyle {F}_{g\perp} = mg\cos{(\alpha)} } . The parallel
component is  F g ∥ = m g sin ⁡ ( α ) {\displaystyle {F}_{g\parallel} =
mg\sin{(\alpha)} } .

_**Perpendicular**_      F n e t ⊥ = m a ⊥ F N − F g ⊥ = m a ⊥ {\displaystyle
\begin{align} {F}_{net\perp} = m{a}_{\perp} \\\\[5 pt] F_N - {F}_{g\perp} =
m{a}_{\perp} \end{align} }

Since the block is stationary in the perpendicular direction, the acceleration
in the perpendicular direction is zero:       F N − F g cos ⁡ ( α ) = 0 F N =
m g cos ⁡ ( α ) . {\displaystyle \begin{align} F_N - F_g \cos{(\alpha)} = 0
\\\\[5pt] F_N = mg \cos{(\alpha)}. \end{align} }

_**Parallel**_      F n e t ∥ = m a ∥ F f s − F g ∥ = m a ∥ {\displaystyle
\begin{align} {F}_{net\parallel} = m{a}_{\parallel} \\\\[5 pt] {F}_{fs} -
{F}_{g\parallel} = m{a}_{\parallel} \end{align} }

Since the block is also stationary in the parallel direction, the acceleration
in the parallel direction is zero:       F f s − F g sin ⁡ ( α ) = 0.
{\displaystyle {F}_{fs} - F_g \sin{(\alpha)} = 0. }

The maximum static friction is calculated using the formula  F f s = μ s F N
{\displaystyle {F}_{fs} = {\mu}_{s} F_N } ; thus,       μ s m g cos ⁡ ( α ) =
m g sin ⁡ ( α ) . {\displaystyle {\mu}_{s} mg \cos{(\alpha)} = mg
\sin{(\alpha)}. }

Solving for the coefficient of static friction  μ s {\displaystyle {\mu}_{s} }
yields       μ s = sin ⁡ ( α ) cos ⁡ ( α ) . {\displaystyle {\mu}_{s} =
\frac{\sin{(\alpha)}}{\cos{(\alpha)}}. }

and since  tan ⁡ ( α ) = sin ⁡ ( α ) cos ⁡ ( α ) {\displaystyle \tan(\alpha) =
\frac{\sin{(\alpha)}}{\cos{(\alpha)}} } , the equation is equivalent to
μ s = tan ⁡ ( α ) . {\displaystyle {\mu}_{s} = \tan(\alpha). }

Finally, solving for the angle  α {\displaystyle \alpha} gives       α = tan −
1 ( μ s ) . {\displaystyle \alpha = {\tan}^{-1}{({\mu}_{s})}. }

**Part 3**

If the coefficient of static friction is 0.8,       α = tan − 1 ( 0.8 ) α =
38.66 ∘ . {\displaystyle \begin{align} \alpha &= {\tan}^{-1}{(0.8)} \\\\[5 pt]
\alpha &= {38.66}^{\circ}. \end{align} }
