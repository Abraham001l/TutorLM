# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon
dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar.

Most life on Earth depends on photosynthesis.The process is carried out by
plants, algae, and some types of bacteria, which capture energy from sunlight
to produce oxygen (O2) and chemical energy stored in glucose (a sugar).
Herbivores then obtain this energy by eating plants, and carnivores obtain it
by eating herbivores.

**The process**

During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O)
from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning
it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains
electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into
glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores
energy within the glucose molecules.

**Chlorophyll**

Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store
the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a
light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving
the plant its green color. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy
from blue- and red-light waves, and reflects green-light waves, making the
plant appear green.

**Light-dependent Reactions vs. Light-independent Reactions**

While there are many steps behind the process of photosynthesis, it can be
broken down into two major stages: light-dependent reactions and light-
independent reactions. The light-dependent reaction takes place within the
thylakoid membrane and requires a steady stream of sunlight, hence the name
light-_dependent_ reaction. The chlorophyll absorbs energy from the light
waves, which is converted into chemical energy in the form of the molecules
ATP and NADPH. The light-independent stage, also known as the Calvin cycle,
takes place in the stroma, the space between the thylakoid membranes and the
chloroplast membranes, and does not require light, hence the name light-
_independent_ reaction. During this stage, energy from the ATP and NADPH
molecules is used to assemble carbohydrate molecules, like glucose, from
carbon dioxide.

**C3 and C4 Photosynthesis**

Not all forms of photosynthesis are created equal, however. There are
different types of photosynthesis, including C3 photosynthesis and C4
photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is used by the majority of plants. It
involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid
during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become glucose. C4 photosynthesis,
on the other hand, produces a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits
into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle. A
benefit of C4 photosynthesis is that by producing higher levels of carbon, it
allows plants to thrive in environments without much light or water.
