Great place for tacos!

Mar 2024 • family

The food here was amazing. I was told the tacos were small but they are not.
One taco was more than I could eat. We also got an order of blanco queso and
chips and when we were getting ready to leave they offered us another bag of
chips at no charge. They have a great variety of hot sauces and additions you
can put on your taco. I got the mushroom madness and it was amazing. Staff was
efficient, service was fast and we left full

Fast, fresh, and affordable!

Apr 2022 • family

We hit the drive through on Easter weekend for affordable burritos and salads
and received great food as always. Food from Fuego is always fast, fresh,
delicious, and inexpensive. We’ll be back!

So good we ate here twice

Mar 2021 • none

This place was near our motel. We ate here for dinner and once for breakfast.
They make the world's most unusual tacos. My wife ordered one that had fried
chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy and corn in it. These tacos are huge. You
have to eat half of it with a knife and fork before you can role it up. They
can be messy too. I liked the breakfast taco better. The employees here are
really hopping. Behind the counter, it was a constant, organized chaos. They
frequently came through the dining room to pick up stuff trash and wipe down
tables. I was watching a young girl bring food out to the drive through
customers. She was continually jogging out to the cars to give them their
food, running back into the building to get more, then running back out. I was
very impressed by her hustle.

Violated food safety standards and COVID-19 food protocols

Dec 2020 • none

Tried to order through the drive thru. After paying for my meal and pulling
forward, I watched as the server brought orders out to three cars behind me
who had ordered after me. I asked for a refund because I was in a hurry and it
was obvious my order was lost. Just then I see the third car after mine open
their window and hand the server back an order saying it was not theirs. The
server and the manger brought me that bag and said here is your order! As if I
was going to accept food which has already been inside someone else’s car,
opened and breathed on - I told the manger I would not take it because of
COVID-19 and I could not believe what I was being asked to take!!! I will not
be attempting to eat here again!!!

Thank you Thad! And to your amazing cooks.

Mar 2021 • family

What a great experience. Thad welcomed my party with open arms. He gave my
four teenage girls a mini tour of this amazing venue. Thad even explained how
everything was prepared and took time to explain the working of his restaurant
as well as shower positive accolades upon his staff. From what I understand we
just happened to arrive during a downtime. Glad we did. Everything was
wonderful. Service was excellent. Great price point. Food was very good. Will
definitely visit again. The restrooms were clean.

Hot mess

Jan 2022 • couples

Hot mess. Order 2 rock star and shrimp tacos. Both were a hot mess of inedible
food. I didn't finish mine. You order and pay at the cashier and the food gets
delivered to your table which is flagged. Music too loud especially if you
don't like the m music. Don't bother coming here. Mexican food should not be
complicated. This food here is not very good.

Yummy!

Sep 2021 • couples

Cobb Salad ... big and very tasty! Fish taco - Fresh, crisp and yummy ... one
is filling unless you a very hungry. Fresh tortilla, of course. Basic
atmosphere, a bit noisy.

Pleasantly Surprised!

Sep 2020 • family

Our standing family rule for years has been to never eat Mexican food north of
Raymondville, Texas. It’s hard to beat the traditional flavors served up in
the Rio Grande Valley. Well that rule has changed with discovery of Fuego
Tortilla Grill. The tacos are great and priced right for those college town
residents. A definite twist on the classic tacos we enjoy at home, but they
are hearty with bold flavor and served on soft homemade flour tortillas - no
store bought frisbees. We’ll be back for more.

Friendly, fast and delicious! An outstanding brick and mortar taco stand!

Feb 2022 • business

I cannot judge this place relative to others in the area, as just passing
through, but I can say my meal was delicious, the patrons were friendly, the
staff even more so, and the establishment was clean and comfortable. Texas has
a lot of Mexican and TexMex establishments to choose from, and our team was
happily guided here by our local partners. Everybody was happily satisfied
with this dinner choice!

Joe cares about his patrons

Mar 2023 • family

While visiting my son and his family in Brenham we went to Fuegot Grill in
College Station. He and the staff are friendly and accommodating to their
guests. We began with guacamole and chips and queso and chips. We enjoyed
eating them until our meals were brought to the table. I had Fuego a-go-go,
and the picture shows the inviting appearance of my taco. We'll, it was very
appealing and I ate it before remembering to photograph it. I don't recall
what the rest of my son and his family had. We had a large serving of
frijoles. It was my 1st visit and may be the last, at least until I return to
Texas from Binghamton, NY. When, not if you go, look for Joe and tell him you
went due to a review you read about his family business. The dad is a GM and a
co owner. Try the brownie!!

Busy, but delicious

Feb 2020 • family

Tons of college kids at 8 pm on a Friday night, however despite being busy,
the food is and always is delicious. I love the Fuego steak and the carne
guisada tacos. My husband loves the nachos. Oh and you can’t forget the queso!
It’s the best! They will even give you a bag of chips to go if you have
leftover queso. Last plus, the drive through! Definitely recommend Fuego!

Tacos are great.

Feb 2020 • none

The tortillas are made fresh right in front of you. The size of the tacos are
amazing and the prices are great. Lots of food for the price. The taste is
very good and so many hot sauces, fresh and bottled.

SO GOOD!!!

Jan 2021 • none

When my son told me about this place, I had to try it. It was amazing. They
have the most unique menu and it was so cheap. The staff was friendly and the
restaurant was clean. They put everything on flatbread. I had what I can only
describe as juevos rancheros and it was delicious! It is a must go in College
Station.

Excellent tacos

Apr 2021 • family

Been here twice now when visiting son and have loved it both times. Usually
super crowded and I know why. This most recent time we actually could eat
inside. Charro beans and quest good, too. Only down side is the tea tastes
like College Station water. Otherwise we love it.
