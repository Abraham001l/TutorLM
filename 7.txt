Biological process to convert light into chemical energy

Schematic of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored
in or used by the plant. Composite image showing the global distribution of
photosynthesis, including both oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial
vegetation. Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic
activity in the ocean and on land, respectively.

**Photosynthesis** (/ˌfoʊtəˈsɪnθəsɪs/ _FOH -tə-SINTH-ə-sis_)[1] is a system of
biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants,
algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into
the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. _Photosynthesis_
usually refers to **oxygenic photosynthesis** , a process that produces
oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms store the chemical energy so produced within
intracellular organic compounds (compounds containing carbon) like sugars,
glycogen, cellulose and starches. To use this stored chemical energy, an
organism's cells metabolize the organic compounds through cellular
respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining
the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the
biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.[2]

Some bacteria also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which uses
bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water,
producing sulfur instead of oxygen. Archaea such as _Halobacterium_ also
perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the
simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used
to absorb green light and power proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), the "energy currency" of cells. Such archaeal
photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that
evolved on Earth, as far back as the Paleoarchean, preceding that of
cyanobacteria (see Purple Earth hypothesis).

While the details may differ between species, the process always begins when
light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers, proteins that contain
photosynthetic pigments or chromophores. In plants, these pigments are
chlorophylls (a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectrums
of light, thus reflecting green) held inside chloroplasts, abundant in leaf
cells. In bacteria, they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-
dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable
substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the
splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that
participate in energetic processes: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) and ATP.

In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent
sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In this
process, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing
organic compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).[3] Using the ATP and
NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are
then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In
other bacteria, different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to
achieve the same end.

The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary
history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide,
rather than water, as sources of electrons.[4] Cyanobacteria appeared later;
the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the
Earth,[5] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. The average
rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130
terawatts,[6][7][8] which is about eight times the total power consumption of
human civilization.[9] Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115
billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billions of metric tons), of carbon into
biomass per year.[10][11] Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan
Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light, not just soil and water.

## Overview

Main article: Biological carbon fixation

Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate
O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar.

Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are
able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy
from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of
carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic
compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.[2]

In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This
**oxygenic photosynthesis** is by far the most common type of photosynthesis
used by living organisms. Some shade-loving plants (sciophytes) produce such
low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves
instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.[12]

Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants,
algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these
organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used
mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or
which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen.[13][14]

Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation;
photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into
carbohydrates. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general
outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while
photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates,
cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to
carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates,
amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon
dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's
metabolism.

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take
place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different
cellular compartments (cellular respiration in mitochondria).[15][16]

The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel
is:[17]     CO2carbon  
dioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate +
2Aoxidized  
electron  
donor + H2Owater

Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the
equation for this process is:      CO2carbon  
dioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen +
H2Owater

This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent
reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling _n_
water molecules from each side gives the net equation:      CO2carbon  
dioxide + H2O water  + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2 oxygen

Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the
electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize
arsenite to arsenate:[18] The equation for this reaction is:      CO2carbon  
dioxide + (AsO3−  
3)  
arsenite + photonslight energy → (AsO3−  
4)  
arsenate + COcarbon  
monoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)[19]

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, _light-dependent
reactions_ or _light reactions_ capture the energy of light and use it to make
the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP. During the
second stage, the _light-independent reactions_ use these products to capture
and reduce carbon dioxide.

Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the
light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or,
more specifically, far-red radiation.[20]

Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some
archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for
vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response
to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more
directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not
involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have
evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.[21]

## Photosynthetic membranes and organelles

Main articles: Chloroplast and Thylakoid

**Chloroplast ultrastructure** :

    1. outer membrane
    2. intermembrane space
    3. inner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)
    4. stroma (aqueous fluid)
    5. thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)
    6. thylakoid membrane
    7. granum (stack of thylakoids)
    8. thylakoid (lamella)
    9. starch
    10. ribosome
    11. plastidial DNA
    12. plastoglobule (drop of lipids)

In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis
are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the
membrane surrounding the cell itself.[22] However, the membrane may be tightly
folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids,[23] or bunched up into round
vesicles called _intracytoplasmic membranes_.[24] These structures can fill
most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area
and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.[23]

In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called
chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The
chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a
phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an
intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the
stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are
the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The
thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the
enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid
membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the
photosynthetic system.

Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of
the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected, which is the reason that
most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments
such as carotenes and xanthophylls.[25] Algae also use chlorophyll, but
various other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and
xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and
fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors.

These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna
proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a
combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex.[26]

Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the
majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves.
Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as
many _Euphorbia_ and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in
their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the
mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every
square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-
resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of
water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize
heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the
palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.

## Light-dependent reactions

Main article: Light-dependent reactions

Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane

In the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll
absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is taken up by a
modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a
quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport
chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this
creates a proton gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast membrane,
which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll
molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is
split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen.

The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of
non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:[27]

2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2

Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic
action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present. For
example, in green plants, the action spectrum resembles the absorption
spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue
and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which
allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper
waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground
green plants. The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives
photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple
bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective
organisms.

### Z scheme

The "Z scheme"

In plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the
chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-
dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.

In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting
antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory
pigments (see diagram "Z-scheme"). The absorption of a photon by the antenna
complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge
separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of
the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the
primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled
through an electron transport chain (the so-called _Z-scheme_ shown in the
diagram), a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations (H+)
across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses
that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas
NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the _Z-scheme_. The
electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further
excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed
along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy.
The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions
across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used
to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the
light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.

The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that
it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic
reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced
from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor
molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the
name _cyclic reaction_.

### Water photolysis

Main articles: Photodissociation and Oxygen evolution

Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center
of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require
re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the
reaction center (P700) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from
plastocyanin, whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem
II. Photosystem II, as the first step of the _Z-scheme_ , requires an external
source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll _a_ reaction center.
The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria
is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive
charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic
oxygen and four hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a
redox-active tyrosine residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This
resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-
dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by
a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion;
this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four
oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction
(Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid
lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential
that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent
reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy
for cellular respiration, including photosynthetic organisms.[28][29]

## Light-independent reactions

### Calvin cycle

Main articles: Calvin cycle and Carbon fixation

In the light-independent (or "dark") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures
CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin cycle, uses the
newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined
to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent
reactions in green plants is[27]: 128

3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3
H2O

Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation

Carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then
converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars
photosynthesis produces are then used to form other organic compounds, such as
the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid and amino acid
biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only
in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed
through a food chain.

The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon
dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to yield
two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate, also known as
3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH
produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde
(PGAL) or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (five out of six
molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates
not thus "recycled" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately
yield sucrose, starch, and cellulose, as well as glucose and fructose. The
sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be
used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and
lipids.

### Carbon concentrating mechanisms

#### On land

Main articles: C4 carbon fixation, CAM photosynthesis, and Alarm
photosynthesis

Overview of C4 carbon fixation. (This image mistakenly shows lactic acid
instead of pyruvate, and all the species ending in "-ate" are shown as
unionized acids, such as malic acid and so on).

In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss.
Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the
light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of
photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants
have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under
these conditions.[30]

Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide
in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP
carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid.
Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to
specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin
cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the
four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon
3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-
generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation
and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf.[31] C4 plants can produce
more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many
important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and
millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called
C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO,
produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-
Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that
use C4 carbon fixation;[32] however, the evolution of C4 in over sixty plant
lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution.[30] C2
photosynthesis, which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of
photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful
carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right.[33]

Xerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to
capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).
In contrast to C4 metabolism, which _spatially_ separates the CO2 fixation to
PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM _temporally_ separates these two processes. CAM
plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night,
when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of
malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is
then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2
inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by
RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants.[34]

Calcium-oxalate-accumulating plants, such as _Amaranthus hybridus_ and
_Colobanthus quitensis,_ show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium
oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide
(CO2) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed.
This process was named alarm photosynthesis. Under stress conditions (e.g.,
water deficit), oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to
CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme, and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin
cycle reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the byproduct of oxalate
oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by catalase. Alarm photosynthesis
represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM
pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways,
operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior
(or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.[35][36]

#### In water

Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of CO2
around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic
anhydrase, located within the carboxysome, releases CO2 from dissolved
hydrocarbonate ions (HCO−  
3). Before the CO2 can diffuse out, RuBisCO concentrated within the
carboxysome quickly sponges it up. HCO−  
3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and
are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the
membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2
very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO−  
3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the
carboxysomes.[37] Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO2
around RuBisCO.[38][39]

## Order and kinetics

The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:[11]

Stage | Event  | Site | Time scale   
---|---|---|---  
1 | Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll | Thylakoid membranes in the chloroplasts | Femtosecond to picosecond  
2 | Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions | Picosecond to nanosecond  
3 | Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis | Microsecond to millisecond  
4 | Carbon fixation and export of stable products | Stroma of the chloroplasts and the cell cytosol | Millisecond to second  
  
## Efficiency

Main article: Photosynthetic efficiency

Plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic
efficiency of 3–6%.[40][41] Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated
primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) reemitted as chlorophyll
fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of
the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.[42]

Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the
light being converted, light intensity, temperature, and proportion of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.[43] By comparison,
solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of
approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory
devices. Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants
with increased yield.[41]

The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured, but the
relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the light reaction
creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules, which C3 plants can use for carbon
fixation or photorespiration.[44] Electrons may also flow to other electron
sinks.[45][46][47] For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to
differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and
under photorespiratory conditions.[48][49][50]

Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and
infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.[51] An integrated
chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system can investigate both light and
dark reactions when researchers use the two separate systems together.[52]
Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to
measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 and of ΔH2O using reliable
methods. CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/(m2/s), parts per million, or
volume per million; and H2O is commonly measured in mmols/(m2/s) or in mbars.
By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure,
leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it becomes possible
to estimate, "A" or carbon assimilation, "E" or transpiration, "gs" or
stomatal conductance, and "Ci" or intracellular CO2.[53] However, it is more
common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where
appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or
F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger
plant populations.[50]

Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below
ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different
CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response.[53]

Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise
measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms.[51][52] While standard gas
exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the
addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more
precise measurement of CC, the estimation of CO2 concentration at the site of
carboxylation in the chloroplast, to replace Ci.[52][54] CO2 concentration in
the chloroplast becomes possible to estimate with the measurement of mesophyll
conductance or gm using an integrated system.[51][52][55]

Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the
amount of light the leaf absorbs, but analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence,
P700- and P515-absorbance, and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed
information about, e.g., the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2
assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength dependency of the
photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.[56]

A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy
transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga,
bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores
arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex. When a photon
is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to
as an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the
reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its
energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's
wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible
paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously "choose" the most
efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its
destination in the minimum possible time.

Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than
quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short
distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the
particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them
once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic "hop".
The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in
a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.[57][58][59]

Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have
been dated at 3.4 billion years old.[60][61] More recent studies also suggest
that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago,[62][63] though
the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes
preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts.[64]

Oxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth's
atmosphere, and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen
catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such
as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era
around two billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most
photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor,
which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center.

### Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts

Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, _Plagiomnium affine_)

Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with
photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges, and sea
anemones. Scientists presume that this is due to the particularly simple body
plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.[65]
In addition, a few marine mollusks, such as _Elysia viridis_ and _Elysia
chlorotica,_ also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they
capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see
Kleptoplasty). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis
for several months at a time.[66][67] Some of the genes from the plant cell
nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can
be supplied with proteins they need to survive.[68]

An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a
circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the
photosynthetic reaction center.[69][70] The endosymbiotic theory suggests that
photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic
cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be
photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like
mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear
DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble
those found in cyanobacteria.[71] DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins
such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR
Hypothesis proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is
required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the
persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.[72]

### Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages

Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded:

    * The glaucophytes and the red and green algae—clade Archaeplastida (uni- and multicellular)
    * The cryptophytes—clade Cryptista (unicellular)
    * The haptophytes—clade Haptista (unicellular)
    * The dinoflagellates and chromerids in the superphylum Myzozoa, and Pseudoblepharisma in the phylum Ciliophora—clade Alveolata (unicellular)
    * The ochrophytes—clade Stramenopila (uni- and multicellular)
    * The chlorarachniophytes and three species of Paulinella in the phylum Cercozoa—clade Rhizaria (unicellular)
    * The euglenids—clade Excavata (unicellular)

Except for the euglenids, which are found within the Excavata, all of these
belong to the Diaphoretickes. Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella
got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary
endosymbiosis in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The
plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and
are referred to as the "red lineages" and the "green lineages". The only known
exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its
plastids that originated from green algae also has a purple sulfur bacterium
as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by
three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A nucleomorph, remnants
of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of
the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and
chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga).[73] Some dinoflagellates that lost
their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic
events with different algae. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of
these eukaryotic groups are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various
degrees.

### Photosynthetic prokaryotic lineages

Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple sulfur and
green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and
used various other molecules than water as electron donors. Green and purple
sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron
donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as
electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific
organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the
geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that
time.[74]

With a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis is not found in
archaea.[75] Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic; they can absorb energy from
the sun, but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not
photosynthetic.[76] Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins, which convert
light-energy to ion gradients but cannot mediate electron transfer
reactions.[77][78]

In bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known:[79][80][81][82]

    * Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis and the only prokaryotes that contain two types of photosystems (type I (RCI), also known as Fe-S type, and type II (RCII), also known as quinone type). The seven remaining prokaryotes have anoxygenic photosynthesis and use versions of either type I or type II.
    * Chlorobi (green sulfur bacteria) Type I
    * Heliobacteria Type I
    * Chloracidobacterium Type I
    * Proteobacteria (purple sulfur bacteria and purple non-sulfur bacteria) Type II (see: Purple bacteria)
    * Chloroflexota (green non-sulfur bacteria) Type II
    * Gemmatimonadota Type II
    * Eremiobacterota Type II

### Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis

The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in
photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria
(formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this
transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320
million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.[83][84] Because
the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated
development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic
cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.[85] Available evidence from
geobiological studies of Archean (>2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that
life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved
is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial
evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of
cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of
oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox
structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen
fixation.[86][87] Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary
producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic,
but only with the Mesozoic (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates,
coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine
shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine
ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of
biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine
algae.[88]

## Experimental history

### Discovery

Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely
understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th
century.

Portrait of Jan Baptist van Helmont by Mary Beale, c. 1674

Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when
he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of
the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little,
he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water,
the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially
accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water.
However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's
biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.

Joseph Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a
volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off
CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax.
He further discovered that a mouse could similarly "injure" air. He then
showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had
"injured."[89]

In 1779, Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that
it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a
mouse in a matter of hours.[89][90]

In 1796, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated
that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the
influence of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure showed that
the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake
of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by
which organisms use photosynthesis to produce food (such as glucose) was
outlined.[91]

### Refinements

Cornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of
photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria, he was
the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox
reaction in which hydrogen reduces (donates its atoms as electrons and protons
to) carbon dioxide.

Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity
using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions
were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more
substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm
wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter
is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll "a", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll
"a" with most of the available chlorophyll "b", among other pigments. These
include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue
algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process
is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and
PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between
the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry.[11]

Robert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate
to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f
to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by
plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further
experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of
green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He
showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural
reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure
to light. In the Hill reaction:[92]     2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) →
2 AH2 + O2

A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is
reduced and oxygen is evolved. Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive
isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from
the water.

Melvin Calvin works in his photosynthesis laboratory.

Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson, along with James Bassham, elucidated the path
of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants.
The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle, but many scientists
refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham
(or CBB) Cycle.

Nobel Prize–winning scientist Rudolph A. Marcus was later able to discover the
function and significance of the electron transport chain.

Otto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis
reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration.[93]

In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation
_in vivo_ was presented by Otto Kandler using intact _Chlorella_ cells and
interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.[94] In 1954,
Daniel I. Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation _in vitro_ in isolated
chloroplasts with the help of P32.[95][96]

Louis N. M. Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll "a" will absorb
one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll "a" (and other pigments)
will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome,
stating the two light reactions are in series.

### Development of the concept

In 1893, the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms,
_photosyntax_ and _photosynthesis_ , for the biological process of _synthesis
of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of
chlorophyll, under the influence of light_. The term _photosynthesis_ is
derived from the Greek _phōs_ (φῶς, gleam) and _sýnthesis_ (σύνθεσις,
arranging together),[97][98][99] while another word that he designated was
_photosyntax_ , from _sýntaxis_ (σύνταξις, configuration). Over time, the term
_photosynthesis_ came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic
photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of
the term.[100]

### C3 : C4 photosynthesis research

In the late 1940s at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of
photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin
Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers
utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.[101] The
pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae _Chlorella_ in a fraction of a second in
light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA).
For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was
awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied
leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf
chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol
CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same
photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of
sunlight.[102][103]

Later in 1958–1963 at Cornell University, field grown maize was reported to
have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be
saturated at near full sunlight.[104][105] This higher rate in maize was
almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean,
indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants.
At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15
species of monocots and dicots uncovered for the first time that differences
in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic
capacities among species.[106][107] In tropical grasses, including maize,
sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf
photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have
two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a
tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of
anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb
Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane.[108] Plant species with
the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent
photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature,
high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion
and rates never saturated at full sun light.[109] The research at Arizona was
designated a Citation Classic in 1986.[107] These species were later termed C4
plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons
as malate and aspartate.[110][111][112] Other species that lack Kranz anatomy
were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon
compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the
C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol
CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3
plants.[106][107]

## Factors

The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants.

There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary
factors. The four main are:[113]

    * Light irradiance and wavelength
    * Water absorption
    * Carbon dioxide concentration
    * Temperature.

Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These
include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to
capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of
photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the
chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the
availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.[114]

### Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature

See also: PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve

Absorbance spectra of free chlorophyll _a_ (blue) and _b_ (red) in a solvent.
The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified _in vivo_
depending on specific pigment–protein interactions.

The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the
biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for
plant life.[115]

The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both
time and space.

In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei
investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on
the rate of carbon assimilation.

    * At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance.
    * At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.

These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known
that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature.
However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of
carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full
process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical'
temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-
dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of
limiting factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light.
Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the
correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in
conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria
have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome.[116] This complex is
made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the
reaction center.

### Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration

Photorespiration

As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by
the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors.
RuBisCO, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent
reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the
concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide.
However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen
instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy,
but does not produce sugars.

RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:

    1. One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the Calvin-Benson cycle.
    2. Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.
    3. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce ammonia (NH3), which is able to diffuse out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.         A highly simplified summary is:             2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3

The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more
commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-
dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.
